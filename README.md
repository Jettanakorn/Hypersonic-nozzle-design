Method of Characteristics Nozzle Design
This web application implements the Method of Characteristics (MOC) for designing optimal rocket nozzle contours. The MOC is a technique used in supersonic flow design to minimize energy losses and maximize thrust.

Key Features:
	\- Designs nozzles for specified combustion chamber conditions.
	\- Calculates optimal contour for given altitude.
	\- Supports input by thrust or mass flow rate.
	\- Models atmospheric conditions based on altitude.
	\- Exports contour data for further analysis.
